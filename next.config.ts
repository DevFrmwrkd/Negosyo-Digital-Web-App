   * /for-business is retired. It shared 11 of its 13 sections with `/` (same
   * pricing, process, proof, FAQ and closing bands), so the two URLs competed
   * for the same query and every copy change had to be made twice — which is
   * how four contradictory edit-policy promises shipped before being audited
   * out. `/` carries the whole owner pitch on its own.
   *
   * permanent: true → 308, because the move is permanent: search engines should
   * transfer the ranking to `/` and inbound links should be rewritten.
   *
   * Destination is `/`, NOT `/start`: inbound links and search results asked
   * for a page that explains the offering, and dropping a cold visitor into a
   * four-step intake form is a worse landing than the one they asked for.
   * /start stays one click away (navbar, hero, pricing card).
   *
   * Only the exact path redirects — /for-business/* never had sub-routes, and
   * redirecting them would turn honest 404s into soft-404s.
